# AirBnB Clone - Web Static

This project is part of the larger AirBnB clone series and focuses on building the static front-end components using HTML and CSS. The goal is to incrementally develop the web interface, starting with basic static pages and gradually adding complexity and styles. 

## Background
In this project, we will create static web pages for an AirBnB clone. This involves designing simple HTML pages and styling them with CSS, focusing on structure before aesthetics. No JavaScript or dynamic data loading will be used at this stage.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to:
- Understand what HTML and CSS are and how they are used to build web pages.
- Create HTML pages and understand the concept of markup languages and the DOM.
